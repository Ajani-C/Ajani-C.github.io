# About Me

Hi, I’m Ajani Cole, a Computer Science student at Florida International University with a strong interest in cybersecurity. I’m passionate about protecting systems and data through network security, penetration testing, and system hardening.

I’ve worked on projects that include vulnerability assessments in virtual labs, analyzing network traffic with Wireshark, and testing password security. These experiences have helped me build a solid foundation in identifying risks, applying mitigation strategies, and thinking critically about how to secure modern systems.

Beyond my technical skills, I enjoy problem-solving and the continuous learning that come with this field. Cybersecurity is constantly evolving, and I’m motivated to stay ahead by experimenting with new tools, studying real-world threats, and expanding my knowledge through hands-on projects.

## Skills and Tools

Languages and Scripting: Python, C and Bash.
Familiar Security Tools: ClamAV, Hashcat, John the Ripper, Nmap, Snort, Wazuh and Wireshark.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>

</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
